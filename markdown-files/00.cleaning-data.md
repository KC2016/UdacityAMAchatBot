## Cleaning the AMA transcripts

Taking the raw input, its necessary to trim out the preamble and figures from the document. 

Following that I thought it would be nice to trim all @ mentions in the transcript. The problem is that people's names are variable numbers of words. From 1 - >3. I still thought perhaps it is valuable to remove the @ + first string in hope that Microsofts's knowledge base knows to exclude people's names. (Let's hope here.)

Really not perfect, but at least this removes all mentions of Palak.Udacity and Grace.Udacity and anyone with a single word handle. 

```
sed  "s/@[Aa-Zz.]*//g" ama_transcript_raw.txt > ama_transcript_at_removed.txt
```
