## Testing chatbot endpoints

After clicking "PUBLISH" you come to a screen with some information about your bot. This contains a personal authentication key, so I won't put that here. 

I use Postman to test APIs and they have very conveniently shown the proper endpoints and all that to test the request using Postman.

If anyone is having trouble here please shoot me a slack message (@Ben Lambert). Postman is a great free resource to test these kinds of applications!

Just to cover the quick pieces of Postman:
- In the 'Headers' tab add two key-value pairs. First is: 
  ```json
  {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
  ```
   and the second is:
   ```json
   {"Authorization": "EndpointKey xxxxxxxx"}
   ```
   which corresponds to the private key that is provided upon creation of the bot. 

-  In the body tab select 'raw' and 'JSON' then you can query your chatbot as follows:
```json
{"question": "what are the expectations of the student leaders?"}
```

And in response from our chatbot we get back the JSON encoded response:
```json
{
    "answers": [
        {
            "questions": [
                "What are the expectations from student leaders from Udacityâ€™s perspective"
            ],
            "answer": "Hi! So what we really want the student leaders to do is be there for all the members in there channel and help in binding and building this community! ",
            "score": 95.0,
            "id": 662,
            "source": "ama_transcript_at_removed.docx",
            "metadata": [],
            "context": {
                "isContextOnly": false,
                "prompts": []
            }
        }
    ],
    "activeLearningEnabled": false
}
```

Pretty cool!!!!
For more information on sending requests to the bots with Postman check this [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/QnAMaker/Quickstarts/get-answer-from-knowledge-base-using-url-tool?pivots=url-test-tool-postman) out.

What we get back is pretty cool here, we even get a score for the answer. With 95.0 representing an answer that the bot is pretty confident in.
